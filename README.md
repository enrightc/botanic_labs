## 5.3 Database Schema
To create a clear visual representation of the database, I used **Lucid Chart** to build a Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). This diagram served as a reference throughout the development process, providing a clear visual representation of the database structure and the relationship between components of the website. Through the development process I continuously updated the ERD to ensure it aligned with the overall design of Bontanic Labs. 

![Entity-relationship Diagram](botanic_labs/media/docs/wireframes/Database_ER_diagram.jpeg)

Although at this stage wishlist and review functionality has not yet been implemented I have left these in the ERD to show the planned future expansion of Botanic Labs, providing a roadmap for how these features can be integrated

### Conclusions from the ERD

1. **User-Centric Design:**
   - The database design centres around user interactions, linking users to profiles and orders. While wishlist and review features are planned for future additions, they have been included in the design for easier integration later. This anticipates user needs as the platform grows.

2. **Organised Product Management:**
   - The product model is structured to include various attributes such as type, season, soil drainage, lifespan, and light exposure. This allows for detailed filtering and helps users find products that match their needs. The option to link up to three recommended products provides users with suggestions, enhancing the browsing experience.

3. **Simple Order Handling:**
   - Orders are organised with individual line items, allowing multiple products per order. This setup ensures accurate order processing and inventory management, as well as facilitating customer support by detailing each product within an order.

4. **Admin-Controlled Article Creation:**
   - The article model is linked to the user model for authorship, with only admin users permitted to add content. This provides a controlled environment for content creation, ensuring high-quality and relevant information is shared with users through articles.

5. **Independent FAQs for Flexibility:**
   - The FAQ section is designed as a standalone model, allowing it to be managed and updated independently of other parts of the database. This is beneficial for quick adjustments and additions without impacting the core user or product data. Only admin can add/edit FAQs. 

6. **Scalability and Expansion:**
   - By planning for wishlist and review models, the database is prepared for future features without the need for significant structural changes. This supports potential growth and additional functionality as user engagement increases.

7. **Reliable Data Connections:**
   - Foreign key relationships ensure secure and reliable connections between models, such as users with profiles and orders with line items. This setup enhances data integrity and consistency across the platform, supporting a smooth user experience and effective data management.

Overall, the ERD for Botanic Labs provides a solid foundation for current features while allowing for future growth by adding wishlists and reviews functionality. It enables a personalised shopping experience, straightforward content management, and flexible product handling, ensuring that both user and admin needs are effectively met.

# 6.0  SKELETON
## 6.1 Wireframes
Prior to commencing the website coding process, wireframes were produced for each page using Figma - a design tool used for creating user interfaces, prototypes, and wireframes. These wireframes served as the initial blueprints, providing a visual roadmap for the website's layout and structure.

It's important to note that while the final web pages evolved from these early plans, some deviations were intentionally made to enhance the user experience and align better with the project's goals.

This iterative process allowed for flexibility in adapting to evolving project requirements, ultimately contributing to the development of a more refined and user-friendly website.

# 7.0 DESIGN

## 7.1 Colour Scheme

For Botanic Labs, a minimalistic approach was chosen to create a calm and visually appealing environment fitting with the natural vibe of gardening. The focus is on keeping it simple and elegant, so users can explore the site without feeling overwhelmed. The colour scheme is low-key but engaging, letting the products themselves take centre stage.


### Primary Colours

•	Background Colour: #FAF7F2
•	This natural, soft beige serves as the primary background colour, providing a neutral base that doesn’t detract from the content on the page. It complements the nature-themed focus of Botanic Labs and creates a clean, fresh atmosphere.

### Accent Colours

•	Primary Button Colour: #C83274
•	The primary action buttons, like “Shop Now” use a vibrant magenta (#C83274). This bold colour provides a stark contrast against the neutral background, drawing attention to call-to-action elements without being overly flashy.
•	Secondary Button Style:
•	Secondary buttons, such as the “Keep Shopping” button, are designed with a clean black-and-white scheme. They have a white background with a black border and black text, creating a subtle contrast with the primary action buttons. This ensures they are easily accessible without overshadowing the main actions.

This colour scheme supports a professional and clean interface, where the focus is on usability and clarity. By keeping the design elements understated, users can concentrate on the primary functions and content of the website without unnecessary distractions.

## Fonts
In Botanic Labs the typography is essential for achieving a modern and sophisticated look while ensuring readability across all content. The primary font used throughout the website is 'Inter', sourced from Google Fonts.

Inter, designed by Rasmus Andersson, is a popular typeface created specifically for digital interfaces. Known for its open apertures, tall x-height, and distinct letterforms, Inter enhances readability, particularly for small text in UI design. These features make it an excellent choice for modern web projects where legibility is key

For headings, 'Inter' adds a touch of professionalism and clarity, making important information stand out. The same font is applied to paragraph text to maintain a unified and consistent visual identity across the interface.

To ensure the text remains legible and visually appealing, a Sans Serif font serves as the fallback option. This guarantees that even if 'Inter' fails to load, the text will still be clear and easy to read.

By consistently using 'Inter' across the website, the design achieves a seamless and polished look, enhancing the user experience and ensuring that all information is easily accessible.

## Accessability
Accessibility is a fundamental aspect of the LidarFind project, ensuring that all users, regardless of ability, can fully interact with the content.

**Colour Contrast:** The colour palette is designed with high contrast in mind, improving readability and ensuring that text and other content stand out against the background. This thoughtful approach provides a visually accessible experience for everyone.

**Font Selection:** Emphasising simplicity and readability, the fonts chosen are clear and easy to read. This choice ensures that the content remains legible for users with different visual abilities, fostering an inclusive user experience.

# 8.0 FEATURES
## 8.2 Existing Features

## 8.3 Future Features
It is hoped that **Botanic Labs** will continute to be expanded upon in the future to enhance user experience and streamline the shopping process. Here are some potential additions:

1. **Reviews and Ratings:** Enabling users to leave reviews and rate products would provide valuable insights for others. This feature would help customers make more informed decisions based on the experiences of fellow gardeners.

2. **Wishlist:** A wishlist feature would allow users to save products they’re interested in for future purchases. This would make it easier for returning customers to quickly find and purchase items they’ve previously considered.

3. **Refined Filtering Options:** While currently users can filter by season, I aim to expand this to include additional attributes like lifespan, type, light exposure, soil drainage, planting period, and flowering period. These refined filters would empower users to tailor their searches and find products that best suit their unique garden conditions.

<div style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; background-color: #fff;">

#### Feature Experimentation with Django Filters

During development, I experimented with Django Filters to explore advanced filtering capabilities. The idea was to let users refine their product searches based on multiple attributes, providing a more precise and personalised shopping experience.

**Approach and Implementation:**

- **Django Filters Integration**: I set up Django Filters to allow for attribute-based filtering on the product listings page. This aimed to make the browsing experience more intuitive.
  
- **Checkboxes for Planting Season**: I explored checkbox filtering for planting season ranges, intending to let users select multiple seasons dynamically. While useful, it proved challenging to implement effectively for dynamic ranges.

- **Testing and Feedback**: Through testing, I found that combining multiple filters was more complex than anticipated. Handling overlapping filters (like combining soil drainage and light exposure) required more refinement than initially expected.

**Temporary Removal of the Feature:**

As the feature wasn’t fully refined, I chose to exclude it from the final version. However, I preserved all progress by creating a dedicated branch, `filter-experiments`. This branch contains the groundwork for these filtering options, ready for future development.

**Next Steps:**

In future iterations, I plan to revisit and refine these features, with the `filter-experiments` branch serving as a foundation. This setup allows me to continue enhancing Botanic Labs' filtering capabilities without affecting the main project’s stability.

## Live deployment
Botanic Labs is deployed live to [Heroku](https://botanic-labs-d446513705ac.herokuapp.com/).

## Local Deployment
To deploy this project locally:

**Step 1: Fork or Clone the Botanic Labs repository**

  1. Login to [GitHub](www.github.com) and navigate to the [Botanic Labs](https://github.com/enrightc/botanic_labs.git) repository. 

  2. You can either:
  - For the repository by clicking the fork button, creating your own copy of the project, or,
  - Clone the repository. 

**Step 2: Insall Dependencies**
  1. Within your IDE install required dependencies with:
    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

**Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables**
  1. Create an env.py file for environment variables, ensuring you add it to .gitignore.
  2. Populate your env.py file with the following (Replace KEY and VALUE with your actual values):
```
import os

os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your_secret_key"
os.environ["LOCAL_HOST"] = "your_local_host"
os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "your_stripe_public_key"
os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "your_stripe_secret_key"
os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "your_stripe_webhook_secret"

```

**Step 4: Run Initial Migrations and Create Superuser**
  1. Run the migrations to set up the database structure:
  ```
  python3 manage.py migrate
  ```

  2. Create a superuser account:
  ```
  python3 manage.py createsuperuser
  ```

## Deployment to Heroku
**Step 1: Setup a PostgreSQL Database**
  1. Set up a PostgreSQL database using a service like AWS (This project uses a Code Institute PostgreSQL database which is only available to students of code Institute).
  2. Note down the database URL for use in Heroku.

**Step 2: Set up Heroku**
  1. Log in to [Heroku](www.heroku.com) and create a new app.
  2. Name the app and select your nearest region.
  3. In the app settings , under **Config Var**, add the following vairable: `DATABASE_URL: "Your PostgreSQL database URL"`
    
**Step 3: Configure the Database**
  1. In settings.py, set up the database:
  ```
  import dj_database_url

  DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
  }
  ```
  **Do not push your code to GitHub whilst this value is in your settings.py**
  2. In the IDE terminal enter `python3 manage.py showmigrations`. If you are  
     connected to the new database you will see a lift of migrations with no 
     ticks next to them. 	
  3. Migrate the database by running the command `python3 manage.py migrate` to 
     migrate the database structure from the project to the new database.  
  4. Create a superuser for your deployed site by using the command `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
  5. In your env.py file add `os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"`
  5. Remove your new database URL from the settings.py and replace it with the following code:
      ```
      if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
      else:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
            }
        }
      ```
  6. Push your changes to GitHub. 

**Step 4: Deploying to Heroku**
  1. Create a Procfile in the apps root directory and add `web: gunicorn botanic_labs.wsgi:application`, ensure a blank line is at the end of the Profile. If it is not already included it may also be necessary to include a runtime.txt in the root directory. You will need to include the python version in your runtime.txt. To find out which version of python you are using use the command `python3 --version` and hen add the correct version to your runtime.txt e.g. `python-3.12.6`.
  2. Log in to Heroku in your IDE. 
  3. To prevent Heroku from collecting static files during deployment run the command `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app your-heroku-app-name`.
  4. Make sie all changes are committed, then push your project to GitHub.
  5. Go to your Heroku dashboard, select your app and navigate to the **Deploy** tab.
  6. Under **Deployment Method** select **GitHub**.
  7. Search for your repository name and click **Connect**.
  8. To ensure Heroku automatically deploys updates from GitHub, click on **Enable Automatic Deploys**.
  9. Finally, deploy your branch by clocking **Deploy Branch**. Once the build is complete the site is now deployed but without any static files.
  10. Update allowed hosts by navigating to settings.py in your IDE and add your deployed site's URL to ALLOWED_HOSTS to ensure it runs in Heroku.
  11. If a Django secret key is in your settings.py it will need to be replaced with an environment vairbale to keep it secure: `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')` You can use an online key generator to obtain a key.
  12. Ensure the SECRET_KEY is included in your env.py file.
  13. Add a different Django secret key to the environment variables in Heroku by going to your app's settings and under **Config Vars** and add the variable SECRET_KEY with a value.
  14. Modify the `DEBUG` setting in settings.py to enable/disbale debug mode based on the environment:
      `DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ`.
  15. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

## AWS Setup for Static and Media Files
1. **Create an S3 Bucket**
   - Log into your AWS account and navigate to the S3 service.
   - Click on "Create Bucket," name it to match your Heroku app, and select the region closest to you.
   - Uncheck the "Block All Public Access" box and create the bucket.

2. **Enable Static Website Hosting**
   - In your new bucket, go to the **Properties** tab.
   - Scroll to **Static Website Hosting**, click **Edit**, and select **Enable**.
   - Use `index.html` and `error.html` as default documents, then save your changes.

3. **Set Up Permissions**
   - In the **Permissions** tab, scroll to **Bucket Policy** and click **Edit**.
   - Use the **Policy Generator** to create a policy:
     - Select **S3 Bucket Policy** as the policy type.
     - Use `*` as the Principal to allow all users.
     - Set **Action** to `GetObject`.
     - Paste your bucket’s ARN (found at the top of the Permissions tab) and append `/*` to specify all objects.
   - Generate and copy the policy, paste it into the **Bucket Policy Editor**, and save.

4. **Configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**
   - In the **Permissions** tab, scroll to the **CORS** section and add the following configuration:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "AllowedHeaders": ["Authorization"],
         "AllowedMethods": ["GET"],
         "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
         "ExposeHeaders": []
       }
     ]
     ```

5. **Set Up IAM for Access**
   - Go back to the AWS dashboard, search for **IAM**, and go to the **User Groups** section.
   - Create a new group (e.g., `your-app-name-group`).
   - Go to **Policies**, create a policy with the **S3FullAccess** template, and customize as follows:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": "s3:*",
           "Resource": [
             "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
             "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - Attach this policy to your group.

6. **Create a User and Assign Permissions**
   - Under **Users**, create a user, select **Programmatic Access**, and add it to your group.
   - Complete the setup and download the CSV with access credentials.

7. **Configure Django for AWS**
   - In `settings.py`, add the following configuration:
     ```python
     if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
         AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'your-bucket-name'
         AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'your-region'
         AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
         AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
         AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

         # Static and media files configuration
         STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
         DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
         STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/static/'
         MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/media/'
     ```

8. **Create Custom Storage Classes**
   - In your project root, create `custom_storages.py` and add:
     ```python
     from django.conf import settings
     from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage

     class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
         location = 'static'

     class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
         location = 'media'
     ```

9. **Set Up Heroku Config Vars**
   - Add AWS keys and values in Heroku: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `USE_AWS=True`.
   - Remove `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` from Heroku’s config variables.

10. **Push and Deploy**
    - Commit changes and push to GitHub. Deploy the updated application to Heroku.
    - Verify that the static files are accessible in the S3 bucket and visible on your live site.

11. **Upload Media Files**
    - In AWS S3, create a `media` folder and upload your media files.
    - Ensure public read access, then confirm they appear on the live site.

## Setting Up Stripe Payments 

1. **Configure Stripe API Keys**
   - Log in to your Stripe account and go to the **API keys** section.
   - Copy your **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key**.
   - Add these keys to your Heroku config variables:
     - `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`: Your Stripe Publishable Key
     - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Your Stripe Secret Key
   - Also include these keys in your local `env.py` file for use in development:
     ```python
     import os
     os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "your-publishable-key")
     os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "your-secret-key")
     ```

2. **Set Up a Webhook for Stripe**
   - In the Stripe Dashboard, navigate to **Developers** > **Webhooks** and click on **Add endpoint**.
   - Enter your deployed site's URL followed by `/checkout/wh/` (e.g., `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`).
   - Set the webhook to listen to **All Events** to ensure you receive all necessary notifications.

3. **Add the Webhook Signing Secret to Heroku and env.py**
   - After creating the webhook, click on **Reveal Signing Secret** and copy the value.
   - In Heroku, add the signing secret as a config variable:
     - `STRIPE_WH_SECRET`: Your Stripe Webhook Signing Secret
   - Include the signing secret in your local `env.py` file as well:
     ```python
     os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "your-webhook-signing-secret")
     ```

By completing these steps, your deployed site and development environment will be fully configured to handle Stripe payments and receive webhook notifications for transaction updates.

## Setting Up Emails on the Deployed Site

1. **Set Up an App Password with Your Email Provider**
   - Go to your email account’s settings and enable **Two-Factor Authentication**.
   - Create an **app password** for your email account. This password allows external apps (like your deployed site) to send emails securely on your behalf.

2. **Configure Email Settings in Heroku**
   - In your Heroku dashboard, navigate to your app's settings and click on **Config Vars**.
   - Add the following email configuration variables:
     - `EMAIL_HOST`: Your email provider’s SMTP server (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com` for Gmail).
     - `EMAIL_HOST_USER`: Your email address.
     - `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`: Your app-specific password.

3. **Add Email Settings to Your Local `env.py` File**
   - For local development, include these email configuration settings in your `env.py` file as well:
     ```python
     import os
     os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST", "your-smtp-server")
     os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "your-email@example.com")
     os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD", "your-app-password")
     ```

By following these steps, your deployed site and local development environment will be configured to send confirmation and notification emails through your chosen email provider.
